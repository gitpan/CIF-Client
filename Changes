Revision history for Perl extension CIF::Client.

0.10    2012-05-07
    - bugfix to Iodef/Url.pm where Regexp::Common qw/URI/ wasn't functioning properly for google spreadsheet phishes

    - [jeff] modified config parsing to allow for [query] sections like [botnet/url] and so 
      on. you can use this to customize the snort output without needing to keep
      multiple config files. see example.conf 
      
    - [jeff] modified snort output plugin to properly handle feeds where the 'address' field contains
      a url. the snort rule will be properly formatted once the url is parsed. "the right thing"
      will happen if eg a port number is specified in the url, or an ip address, and so on. 
      only urls specifying the http protocol are processed.
